# Acesso-Porta-Paralela
A program that access the LPT Port (with byte or bit by bit)

## Useful information
- Windows GUI application
- This program uses the Inpout32.dll (included in this repo)
- May need som extra files (Vcl40.bpl, borlndmm.dll, and maybe another files asked by windows)
- most of logic and important programming will be at **Unit1.cpp** file. The parallel port information in this file can be used to make, for example, a Console application based on Inpout32.dll too.
- Written in Borland C++ Builder 4 (best framework to edit this code)
